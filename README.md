# FingerprintScanner
Code for fingerprint acquisition and processing
.
"FingerprintControl with Visual Studio" contains the code to connect the device to the computer and to get a fingerprint image.

"Fingerprint Processing" contains the code to enhance the fingerprint.

"SerialPort" is a small Arduino code to perform the connection between the computer and the device. The Arduino can be replaced by an FTDI.

"GT-511C1R_datasheet_V1 5_20140312.pdf" is the datasheet of the device.

"Fingeprint documentation.pdf" explains quickly how to connect the device.

"image.bmp", "test1.bmp" and "test2.bmp" are fingerprint images taken with the device.
